<h1>CSS TO THE RESCUE</h1>

<h2>Concept</h2>
I'm making a website that changes depending on the current weather, the 4 options are sunny, rainy, thunder and snowy
Every version of the website has different elements representing that weather type, the "sunny" version of the website for example has suns and sunrays moving across the screen.

<h2>IMAGE WEBSITE</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/thijsbordewijk/css-to-the-rescue-1920/blob/master/docs/img/landingpage.PNG" alt="Landing page">

<h2>Usage</h2>
This weather can be simulated by the 4 buttons on top of the page, if this website was connected to the DarkSky API, these buttons would not be there and the colours would change depending on the data fetched from the API.

<h2>External data</h2>
For this website the DarkSky API would be used, this API gives out current and future weather information, everything from temperature to humidity. My website would fetch the summary of the weather for the day form this API and style the website after this data.
